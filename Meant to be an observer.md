# Meant to be an observer?

is this who I am naturally? just to observe the scenario around me? or is it in my human nature  to be a *part* of what's around me? is it the joint between the fingers that has somehow conditioned me to zone out and observe the world, the party, the social energy around me, and become a passive viewer? is it the porn, the instagram, the social media, all the cheap dopamine that has relegated me to a viewer? is porn the passive sex replacement? instagram the passive social replacement? do these shitty meme pages make me feel like i am in some sort of a cult friend group when it's broadcasted around the world and i am just another one of the views? Am I meant to be an observer or is my brain too fucked from the cheap dopamine i am exposed to? I must detox. I must detox.
